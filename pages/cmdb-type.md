## Declare the broad software classification

Use `CMDB_TYPE` for the broad classification of the application. CMDB itself
uses `"application"`. Discovery stores the value in `SoftwareSystem.type`.
The parser accepts a literal string; it does not enforce a vocabulary. Setting
the type does not remove a named application from discovery targets.

Example declaration alongside the required version:

```python
VERSION = "1.2.3"
CMDB_TYPE = "application"
```

Place the literal at module or class scope in the application's constants file.
Annotated assignments are also supported. Values are trimmed and must be
nonempty strings of at most 255 characters, without control characters.
Missing, computed, or invalid values are ignored and do not erase metadata
already stored for a matching release.

See [shared metadata rules]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/app-discovery.md %}#shared-metadata-rules)
for constants-file placement, registration, and how discovery handles omitted or
conflicting metadata across releases and hosts.
